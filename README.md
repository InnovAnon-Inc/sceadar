Statistics Routines in Python
==========
Pronounced "skeeter" or something like that.

We will be computing various statistics on arbitrary, presumably binary data.
This project is intended to provide the feature extraction mechanisms for
future projects, including:
- Simon, the Drawerer, v3: a system for generating "realistic" "test" data
  (i.e., v3 will have support for generating "more releastic" data)
- FAPS (Function Auto-Parameterizing (auto-optimizing) System):
  automatically selects the "best" parameters to a function
- g-hOSt:
  - "g" is the successor to "f" as in the Finux Cluster v2,
    which featured:
    - rambooting liveCDs using debootstrap
    - PGO-recompiled binaries (implementing "hive adaption")
  - this will begin as a UEFI-level shell, and hopefully evolve into a
    micro-/exo-kernel written in a non-standard language like PECLR
    (Parallel Environment for Optimal Lambda Calculus Reduction), or even
    using an "efficient" LC implementation as an IR for a
    translator/compiler/interpreter.
