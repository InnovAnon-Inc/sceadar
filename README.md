Pronounced "skeeter" or something like that.

We will be computing various statistics on arbitrary, presumably binary data.
This project is intended to provide the feature extraction mechanisms for
future projects, including:
- Simon, the Drawerer, v3: a system for generating "realistic" "test" data
  (i.e., v3 will have support for generating "more releastic" data)
- ?: a system for function parameter auto-optimization
